# songcount

## Features

- Please `npm install` to get all dependencies! 
- Then`nodemon server.js` to start the server
- Then Q1 and Q2 to be written to the output.txt 


## Technologies
- Express (as a good visual to parse the data and to refresh the incoming ndjson stream) 
- NodeJS 
- MongoDB 

## Note 
- `song.ndjson` is in there with 20 songs for quick testing to make sure basic functionality was working at first. However, I've set it so that the original 2k `songs.ndjson` is being streamed in, so no need to change anything.
